## Quick Manual Deployment

```

### Step 2: Upload via Hostinger File Manager

4. **Delete all existing files** in `/public_html/` 
5. **Upload all files from `dist/` folder** to `/public_html/`

**For Admin Dashboard:**
6. **Create folder:** `/public_html/admin/` (if it doesn't exist)
7. **Upload all files from `admin-dashboard/dist/` folder** to `/public_html/admin/`
