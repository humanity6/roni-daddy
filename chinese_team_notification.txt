üö® IMPORTANT: POLLING BEHAVIOR UPDATE

Dear Chinese API Integration Team,

We have detected continuous polling from your system (IP: 103.213.96.36) 
to our payment status endpoint: /api/chinese/payment/{third_id}/status

CURRENT ISSUE:
- Your system polls completed payments indefinitely
- This creates unnecessary server load and log noise
- Payments with status=3 (PAID) should stop being polled

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Our endpoint now returns "polling_complete": true for final statuses
- Added "message" field indicating when to stop polling
- Status 3=PAID, 4=FAILED, 5=ERROR are all FINAL states

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Update your polling logic to stop when "polling_complete": true
2. Implement timeout/max attempts (e.g., stop after 5 minutes)
3. Consider implementing webhook notifications instead of polling

ARCHITECTURAL NOTE:
According to your API documentation, you should be sending US webhook 
notifications about payment status changes, not polling our custom endpoint.

The proper flow should be:
1. We send payData to you ‚úÖ 
2. We send orderData to you ‚úÖ
3. YOU send payStatus webhooks to US ‚ùå (currently missing)

Please coordinate with your development team to implement proper 
webhook notifications or update your polling logic.

Best regards,
PimpMyCase API Team
